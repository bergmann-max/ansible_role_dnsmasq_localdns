## Description

This Ansible role installs and configures **dnsmasq** as a **local DNS resolver** and **DNS forwarder**.  
It sets up **custom DNS records**, defines **local SRV services**, and integrates with **systemd-resolved** for smooth local name resolution.

### Features:
- Supports **Debian-family systems** (Debian, Ubuntu)
- Configures **dnsmasq** to listen on specific interfaces and IP addresses
- Provides **custom DNS records** (hosts file)
- Defines **local domain** and SRV service records
- Integrates cleanly with **systemd-resolved**
- Includes **DNS caching** for performance
- **Sanity Checks** and proper handlers for smooth deployment
- Secure and minimal â€” strictly focused on **local DNS**

## Supported Platforms

Any APT-based Debian-family system (Ubuntu, Debian).

## Usage Example

```yaml
- name: Configure local DNS resolver via dnsmasq
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: ansible_role_dnsmasq_localdns
      vars:
        dnsmasq_interface: "ens3"
        dnsmasq_dns_server: "1.1.1.1"
        dnsmasq_local_domain: "home.lan"
        dnsmasq_listen_addresses:
          - "127.0.0.1"
          - "192.168.1.1"
        dnsmasq_localdns_hosts:
          - "192.168.1.10 nas.home.lan"
          - "192.168.1.20 media.home.lan"

## Sanity Checks

The role ensures:

- `dnsmasq` is installed and running
- Configured to listen only on intended interfaces/IPs
- `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.conf` and `/etc/hosts.dnsmasq` files are correctly templated
- `systemd-resolved` is adjusted (`DNSStubListener=no`)
- SRV records and hosts entries are properly applied
- DNS caching is enabled as expected
